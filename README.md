# Gamealytical
 
A video game wiki web application using Semantic Web and Linked Data principles.

### Description

A video game wiki web application using Semantic Web and Linked Data principles. The user can query a specific video game and view numerous details about it, or browse among a vast spectrum of 10,000 video games in a user-friendly interface composed of RDF data returned from DBPedia by using SPARQL services.

### Usage

1. Start the Java Maven application. This will boot up the REST API needed for SPARQL query execution on DBPedia's SPARQL endpoint.
2. Start the React application. First, make sure port 3000 on your localhost is not being used by another service. After that, open your terminal, navigate to the "gamealytical-frontend" directory and enter the command "npm start". The development server will start and your default browser will open automatically.
